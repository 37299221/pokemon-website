<h1 style="text-align: center; padding: 50px;">Breeding</h1>

<h2>Daycare</h2>

<p>Pokemon can be bred in a daycare if paired with a suitable pokemon. The suitability is determined by a number of things: </p>

<ul>
<li>Gender - Pokemon can only make an egg if bred by a different gender. </li>
<li>Egg group - Pokemon can only be bred if in the same egg group. </li>
<li>If the pokemon being bred is a legendary / mythical - Most legendaries and mythicals cannot breed. </li>
</ul>

<p>If the pokemon being bred is a legendary / mythical - Most legendaries and mythicals cannot breed. </p>

<h2>Egg moves</h2>

<p>This is a complex method to obtain exclusive moves on a pokemon cannot know otherwise. In pokemon Sword/Shield, this is done by: </p>

<ol>

<li>Finding which egg move that you want to learn and which pokemon that can learn it by using external resources. If this pokemon is in the same egg group as the pokemon that you want to have an egg move on, start the next step.</li>
<li>Breed a male pokemon of which you want to have with the other researched pokemon with the egg move learned. Breeding these two pokemon will result in an offspring with an egg move already learned. </li>
<li>If you want another pokemon of the same species to learn this egg move, just delete a single move slot on this pokemon and put the two pokemon in the daycare. Just walk around for a bit and the other pokemon should now have an egg move</li>

</ol>

<h2>Masuda method</h2>

<!--Add link to shininess here-->
<p>As explained here, the masuda method is a shiny hunting method used to increase the chance of finding a shiny. This is used as it is accessible and reliable. </p>

<h2>Moving down natures and IVs </h2>

<p>For people that want to play competitive pokemon or people who just want a powerful pokemon, breeding is basically essential.</p>

<!--Add links to natures and IVs & EVs here-->
<p>As of recently, both natures and IVs can be brought down to offspring when breeding, which can be used to eventually get the best version of a pokemon. This is by using the two held items ‘everstone’ and ‘destiny knot’. This is what they do: </p>

<ul>
<li>Everstone - An everstone is used to pass down the exact same nature that the pokemon has when being held to the offspring. For example, if a charmander had a modest nature while holding an everstone, the offspring will always have a modest nature (unless the other pokemon has an everstone, which then it is a 50/50 chance of having the same nature).</li>
<li>Destiny knot - This is used to bring down 5 IVs of either of the pokemon being bred. For example, in the charts below:</li>
</ul>

<p>The IVs chosen are shown above in green. As there cannot be 6 stats chosen to pass down, one stat will have random IVs. This is highlighted in red (Sp.Atk). The final IV spread is shown below.</p>

<p>This process in theory can be continued until every stat has a 31 IV, making the best possible pokemon. </p>
