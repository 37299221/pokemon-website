<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>The main way that pokemon battle each other is by using moves. Each move has a certain power, accuracy and power point (PP) value. In addition to this, they all have a type associated with it. Not all moves do damage however, and may do something completely different.</p>

<h2>Attacking moves</h2>

	<p>Moves can be assigned to ‘Special’ or ‘Physical’, which determines what stat is used for damage calculation ingame. </p>

	<p>Special = Sp.Atk </p>

	<p>Physical = Atk</p>

	<p>However, some moves like ‘counter’ have a varying power value depending on what happens in battle. ‘Counter’ in this example will only do damage if the pokemon using it has been hit with a  physical attack</p>


<h2>Status moves</h2>

	<p>Status moves have a variety of roles within a battle. Moves like ‘protect’ can negate the effects of an incoming attack and moves like swords dance’ can raise a stat. There are even more examples like this with even more effects, but are very helpful in battle.</p>

<h2>Other important points</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Critical hits- Critical hits are a luck-based event that only occurs on an attacking move (special or physical). Although changed in a few games, critical hits have a damage multiplier of 1.5. Critical hits can also completely nullify in-battle defense / special defense increases.</li>

	<li>Priority - Although not many moves have this, some moves can ignore the speed stat. What I mean by this is if a move has +1 priority it will always move first. On the other hand, a -1 priority will cause it to move last. The only thing that can overcome this is either a larger priority (can be between -7 and +7).</li>

	<li>Learning moves - The main ways a pokemon can learn moves is by levelling up or learning it via technical machines (which come in different varieties). However, there are other, more difficult ways that a pokemon can learn a move, these being: </li>
</ul>

<ul><ul>
		<li>Breeding for egg moves</li>
		<li>Taught by move tutors</li>
		<li>Evolving</li>
		<li>Move reminders</li>
</ul></ul>
