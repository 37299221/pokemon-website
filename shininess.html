<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>If you have played pokemon before, you may or may not know about that famous ‘red gyarados’ first appearing in Pokemon Gold / Silver. These games were the first games to incorporate shiny pokemon in, which is exactly what the red gyarados is. </p>

<!-- Red Gyarados here-->
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/shiny_gyarados.png" alt="Red Gyarados" style="width:500px; height:500px; margin-bottom: 20px;" class="img-thumbnail">
</div>

<p>Shiny pokemon, except for the red gyarados, have a 1/4096 chance of being shiny. In older games, this chance was halved to a 1/8192. The only purpose of shiny pokemon is to change colour. And to create a sparkle when they enter a battle, of course. </p>

<p>Most people never see a single shiny pokemon when playing through any of the pokemon games. However, there are certain methods to increase the chance of finding a shiny pokemon.</p>

<h2>Shiny charm</h2>

<p>After completing the task of catching every pokemon, trainers are awarded with a key item known as a ‘shiny charm’. This item permanently increases the chance of finding a shiny from 1/4096 to 1/1365 in the most recent games. Without spending a lot of time encountering pokemon, you may still never find a shiny. However, there are also alternatives to finding other shiny pokemon. </p>

<h2>Shiny hunting methods</h2>

<p>Shiny hunting methods are used to increase the likelihood of finding Pokemon Sword/Shield. These are known as ‘Knockout method’, ‘Masuda method’ and ‘Dynamax adventures’.</p>

<ul>
<li>Knockout method - This method requires you to faint a certain pokemon up to 500 times to increase the chance of finding a shiny. Put simply, the higher the amount of pokemon knocked out, the more likely you are to find a shiny pokemon of that species. </li>
<li>Masuda method - Masuda method is a recurring method in the pokemon series. This method centers around the breeding mechanic in the games. To start this method, all you will need to do is breed two pokemon with one being from a foreign country (must be a different language). With this, shiny odds will be close to 1/700.  </li>
<li>Dynamax adventures - Only available in the expansion pass of Sword/Shield, shiny pokemon appearing in dynamax adventures have a 1/300 chance of appearing shiny. However, shininess will only appear once you have caught that pokemon</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these methods listed above can have their shiny chance lowered having the shiny charm.  </p>

<p>Other examples of shiny hunting methods in other pokemon games could be: </p>

<ul>
<li>Radar chaining</li>
<li>Catch combo</li>
<li>Chain fishing</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:20px;">DexNav chaining</li>
</ul>
